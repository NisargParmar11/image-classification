# Image Classification with CIFAR-10 Dataset

This code provides a Python implementation for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset and TensorFlow/Keras. It includes loading the dataset, building and training a convolutional neural network (CNN), evaluating the model, and making predictions on new images.



## Usage

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded and normalized to prepare it for training and testing.

2. **Model Architecture**: A CNN model is defined with convolutional and dense layers.

3. **Model Training**: The model is compiled with an optimizer and loss function, then trained on the training images and labels.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on the testing dataset to calculate loss and accuracy.

5. **Saving the Model**: The trained model is saved for future use.

6. **Image Classification**: You can use the saved model to classify new images. Simply load the image, preprocess it, and use the model for prediction.
